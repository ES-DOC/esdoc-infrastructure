# The ES-DOC Project

## Scope

* overview of the ES-DOC project as a whole


## About the whole process

* ES-DOC is in fact a very difficult project since there are lots of:
  * "moving parts";
  * documents involved;
  * sociological aspects (we can't tell the modelling community what to do,
    notably force them to document their work in our system and to do so in
    time for when we want them to).
